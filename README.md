# S O C I E T Y : The Game

# KAN: MAKE A "TABLE OF CONTENTS" HERE #

## Overview

**_Society_** is a fun multiplayer experience for all ages that brings the childhood concept of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" to a whole *new* level.

Built upon the iteration of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" by software development leader **Sam Kass**, which was featured in the CBS hit-comedy **"The Big Bang Theory"** (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8), the game adds a satirical theme with familiar elements from our society: “Rich”, “Bum”, “Cop”, “Tax”, “Jail”.

Players must predict their opponent’s choices based on a Health-Points system attached to each option.
The health-points of each option decline once that option is overcome by a “superior” one.
As these points reach zero, that option will be rendered unavailable, and the player must choose the next option with much more care than before.

Society allows its players to invite friends into **Private Games**; *or* they may choose to join a **Public Queue**, which matches each player according to their skill level (**Match-Making Rating**).
When a player enters this overall Queue, they must battle opponents and climb to the top of the **Leaderboard**.
