        <p>Society is a fun multiplayer game for all ages that involves two players battling out in a game of wits, dashed with a pinch of luck --and then some!</p>

        <p>Players choose different play options they think would beat what their opponents may choose.  Predicting what your opponent may pick to the best of your ability is crucial in getting an edge in Society as if your option is beat, because you're able to use that option one less time if you lose with it.</p>

        <p>Players can invite their friends to join them in private rooms for a friendly match, or may choose to join a queue where they will be pitted against players around their same matchmaking rating!</p>

        <p>Players, not in a friendly match with a friend, will fight to claim the top of the leaderboards to show off their skills to the world!</p>
